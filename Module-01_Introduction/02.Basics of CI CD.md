## 🔧 **Basics of CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery/Deployment)**

---

### 🧪 **1. What is CI? (Continuous Integration)**

> CI is the process of **automatically building and testing your code** every time a developer makes a change and pushes it to a shared repository (like GitHub).

✅ **Purpose**:

* Detect bugs early
* Integrate code frequently
* Avoid “it works on my machine” issues

🔄 **Common CI Tasks**:

* Code checkout
* Compile/build
* Run unit tests
* Static code analysis (linting, security checks)
* Generate reports

---

### 🚀 **2. What is CD?**

CD has two meanings, depending on the context:

---

#### a. **Continuous Delivery**

> Automatically **prepare** your code for deployment to staging or production, but **requires manual approval** to deploy.

✅ Example:

* Push code → Run tests → Build Docker image → Deploy to staging
* Manual approval → Deploy to production

---

#### b. **Continuous Deployment**

> Fully **automated** process: Code pushed → tested → deployed to production **without human intervention**.

✅ Best for fast-moving apps or microservices.
⚠️ Requires strong automated testing and monitoring.

### 📦 **Benefits of CI/CD**

* 🕒 Faster time to market
* 🧪 Early bug detection
* 🔄 Reliable & repeatable releases
* 🙌 Better team collaboration
* ⚙️ Automation reduces manual errors
* 🚨 Quick rollback if something fails

### 🔨 **CI/CD Tools**

| Category        | Examples                                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Version Control | Git, GitHub, GitLab                          |
| CI/CD Platforms | GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI |
| Build Tools     | Maven, Gradle, npm                           |
| Deployment      | Docker, Kubernetes, Helm                     |
| Monitoring      | Prometheus, Grafana                          |

### 📁 **Typical CI/CD Pipeline Flow**

```
Developer Pushes Code ➜
CI Pipeline Triggers ➜
- Build Code
- Run Tests
- Lint Code
- Build Docker Image

CD Pipeline Triggers ➜
- Deploy to Dev or Staging
- Approval (optional)
- Deploy to Production
```

## 💼 **Real-Time Project Example: Online Banking System**

---

### 🔐 **Project Name**: Mercury Online Banking Platform

### 📦 Tech Stack:

* Frontend: React
* Backend: Java Spring Boot
* Database: PostgreSQL
* DevOps: GitHub Actions + Docker + Kubernetes (AKS or EKS)

### ⚙️ **CI/CD Pipeline Breakdown**

| Stage  | Task                        |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| **CI** | - Checkout code from GitHub |

```
         - Compile Java code  
         - Run JUnit tests  
         - Run ESLint on React frontend  
         - Build Docker images for frontend & backend |
```

\| **CD**    | - Push Docker images to ECR/DockerHub
\- Deploy to Development AKS cluster using Helm
\- Run integration tests
\- Manual approval via GitHub
\- Deploy to Production |

---

### ✅ **Outcome**

* Developers merge PR → GitHub Actions starts CI
* Code is tested, packaged, and Dockerized
* Automatically deployed to Dev
* Production deployment happens only after approval
