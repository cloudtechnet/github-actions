## **how to execute multiple jobs in sequence**


## 🔹 **Why `needs` is Important**

By default:

* GitHub Actions **runs jobs in parallel** to save time.
* But sometimes you want **one job to wait** until another finishes successfully.

The `needs` keyword:

* Makes a job **dependent** on one or more other jobs.
* Ensures **sequential execution** in the order you define.

## 🛠 **Example: Sequential Jobs Workflow**

```yaml
name: Sequential Jobs Example

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Step 1 - Build
        run: echo "Building the application..."

  job2:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: job1
    steps:
      - name: Step 2 - Test
        run: echo "Running tests..."

  job3:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: job2
    steps:
      - name: Step 3 - Deploy
        run: echo "Deploying application..."
```

### 🔍 **How It Runs**

1. **`job1`** → runs first (build stage).
2. **`job2`** → waits until `job1` is finished successfully.
3. **`job3`** → waits until `job2` is finished successfully.

Result: **Build → Test → Deploy** in order.

## 🧠 **Multiple Dependencies**

You can make a job depend on **multiple previous jobs**:

```yaml
job3:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: [job1, job2] # Runs only after BOTH job1 and job2 succeed
  steps:
    - run: echo "Final deployment step..."
```

## 🎯 **Real-world Example (E-commerce App)**

For an **E-commerce backend pipeline**:

* `job1` → Build Docker image for backend service.
* `job2` → Run integration tests.
* `job3` → Deploy to staging environment.
