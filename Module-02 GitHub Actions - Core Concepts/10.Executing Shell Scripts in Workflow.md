## üêö **Executing Shell Scripts in GitHub Actions Workflow**

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Basic Shell Command in a Step**

You can run any shell command or script directly in a `run:` step.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Run simple shell command
    run: echo "Hello from shell!"
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Running Multi-line Shell Scripts**

Use the pipe `|` symbol and indent your commands under `run:` for multiple lines:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Run multi-line shell script
    run: |
      echo "Starting script"
      pwd
      ls -l
      echo "Script finished"
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Executing a Separate Shell Script File**

If your repo contains a shell script file (e.g., `scripts/deploy.sh`), you can run it like this:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout code
    uses: actions/checkout@v3

  - name: Run deploy script
    run: bash ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

> **Make sure your script has execute permissions.**
