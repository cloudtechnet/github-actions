## ðŸ”¸ Multi-Line Commands in GitHub Actions

---

### Why use multi-line commands?

* Complex scripts often need multiple shell commands.
* Writing them as a **single `run` step** keeps your workflow clean.
* Improves readability and maintainability.

---

### How to write multi-line commands?

In a GitHub Actions workflow, use the pipe `|` symbol and indentation under `run:` to write multi-line shell scripts.

---

### Example:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Run multi-line shell commands
    run: |
      echo "Starting build process"
      npm install
      npm run lint
      npm test
      echo "Build completed successfully"
```

* Each line runs sequentially.
* You can use any shell commands here.

## ðŸ”¸ Executing Third-Party Libraries in Workflows

---

### What does this mean?

* Often you want to use tools or libraries **not included** by default on the runner.
* Examples: Python packages, Node.js modules, AWS CLI, Terraform, Docker, etc.
* You **install** or **set up** these libraries before running commands that depend on them.

### How to use third-party libraries?

1. **Setup the environment**
   Use setup actions or install commands.

2. **Run commands using the installed tools**

### Examples:

#### Example 1: Using Python libraries

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Set up Python
    uses: actions/setup-python@v4
    with:
      python-version: '3.10'

  - name: Install dependencies
    run: pip install requests boto3

  - name: Run Python script
    run: python my_script.py
```

#### Example 2: Using Node.js packages

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Set up Node.js
    uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
      node-version: '18'

  - name: Install npm packages
    run: npm install

  - name: Run tests
    run: npm test
```
