## 📦 **What Are Artifacts in GitHub Actions?**

* **Artifacts** are files or data that a workflow job saves for later use.
* Useful for:

  * Sharing data between jobs in a workflow.
  * Storing build outputs, logs, or test results.
  * Keeping files for future download from GitHub.

Think of them as **temporary storage** that survives after a job finishes.

## 🛠 **Storing Data as Artifacts**

GitHub provides an official action:
`actions/upload-artifact`

---

### **Example: Save Build Output**

```yaml
name: Save Artifacts Example

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build Project
        run: |
          mkdir output
          echo "Build completed successfully" > output/build-log.txt

      - name: Upload Build Output as Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: build-files
          path: output/
```

---

## 🛠 **Downloading Artifacts in Another Job**

Use `actions/download-artifact` to retrieve files in another job.

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Download Build Output
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: build-files
          path: downloaded_build

      - name: Display Build Log
        run: cat downloaded_build/build-log.txt
```

---

## 🔍 **Workflow Flow**

1. **Build Job**

   * Generates files.
   * Uploads them as an artifact.
2. **Test Job**

   * Waits for `build` to finish (`needs: build`).
   * Downloads the artifact.
   * Uses the data in further steps.

---

## 🎯 **Real-World Example (Banking Application)**

* **Job 1 (Build)** → Compile backend API, generate `.jar` file.
* **Job 2 (Test)** → Download `.jar` from artifacts and run automated API tests.
* **Job 3 (Deploy)** → Deploy only if tests pass.
