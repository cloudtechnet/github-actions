## ‚öô **What is the Checkout Action?**

* The **`actions/checkout`** action **downloads (clones)** your repository‚Äôs source code into the runner‚Äôs workspace.
* Without it, your workflow jobs **cannot access your code files** ‚Äî they‚Äôll just run in an empty VM.

---

## **Why Do We Need It?**

* Most workflows (build, test, deploy) need access to your code.
* This is the **first step** in most CI/CD pipelines.
* It allows later steps to:

  * Build the app
  * Run tests
  * Package code into Docker images
  * Deploy to servers

---

## üõ† **Basic Configuration**

**YAML Example:**

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout Code
    uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

This will:

* Fetch your code from the repo
* Place it in the working directory of the GitHub runner

---

## üîç **Advanced Configuration Options**

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout Code (Custom)
    uses: actions/checkout@v3
    with:
      ref: main           # Branch, tag, or commit to checkout
      fetch-depth: 0      # Fetch all history (needed for full git log)
      submodules: true    # Checkout submodules if repo has them
      token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Use custom token for private repos
```

### **Key Parameters**

| Parameter     | Description                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `ref`         | Specific branch, tag, or SHA to checkout      |
| `fetch-depth` | How much history to fetch (default: 1 commit) |
| `submodules`  | Whether to checkout Git submodules            |
| `token`       | Token for authentication (private repos)      |

## üîó **Example in a Full Workflow**

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
```

**Flow:**

1. `checkout` gets the code
2. `npm install` installs packages from your code
3. `npm test` runs tests on that code

---

## üéØ **Real-Life Example (Banking App)**

For a **Banking Application Backend** in Java:

* `actions/checkout@v3` gets the **Account Service** source code.
* Next steps run **Maven build** and **JUnit tests**.
* Later, the workflow **builds a Docker image** and **deploys to Kubernetes**.
