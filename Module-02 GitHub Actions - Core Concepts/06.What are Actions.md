## ⚙ **What Are Actions in GitHub Actions?**

---

### **📌 Definition**

In **GitHub Actions**, an **Action** is a **reusable piece of code** that performs a specific task in a workflow.
Think of it as a **prebuilt function** you can call inside your workflow steps.

---

### **🔍 Key Points**

* Actions are **building blocks** of workflows.
* Each **step** in a job can use:

  * **An action** (prebuilt or custom)
  * **A shell command** (e.g., `run: echo "Hello"`)
* Actions can be **reused across projects**.
* They are written in **JavaScript** or **Docker containers**.

### **📦 Types of Actions**

1. **Official Actions** – Created and maintained by GitHub
   Example: `actions/checkout` → checks out your repo code.
2. **Community Actions** – Shared on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) by developers.
3. **Custom Actions** – Actions you create for your own workflows.

### **🗂 Examples of Common Actions**

| Action Name                | Purpose                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `actions/checkout`         | Checkout repository code             |
| `actions/setup-node`       | Install & configure Node.js          |
| `actions/upload-artifact`  | Save files generated by the workflow |
| `actions/cache`            | Cache dependencies for faster builds |
| `docker/build-push-action` | Build & push Docker images           |

### **🛠 Syntax to Use an Action**

```yaml
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

### **💡 Example in a Workflow**

```yaml
name: Example Workflow
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Using an official action
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Using a shell command
      - name: Say Hello
        run: echo "Hello from GitHub Actions!"
```

### **🎯 Why Use Actions?**

* Save time — no need to write common tasks from scratch.
* Ensure consistency across multiple projects.
* Leverage **open-source community** work.
* Combine multiple actions to form powerful CI/CD pipelines.
